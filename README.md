## About Project

The *Automated Report Generation* project is a Python-based solution designed to streamline the process of analyzing data and generating professional reports. This project was developed as part of a 4-week internship at CodTech IT Solutions under the guidance of mentor Neela Santosh.

The main objective of this project is to automatically read sales data from a CSV file, generate insightful visualizations using matplotlib, and compile them into a PDF report using fpdf. The script calculates total sales, identifies the top-performing product, and creates a bar chart for visual representation.

This application improves productivity by eliminating manual reporting tasks and allows easy customization for different datasets and formats. It can be extended to support Excel files, email delivery, or even integration with databases.
